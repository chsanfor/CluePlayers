1. seenArray was changed to primitive boolean type, because wrapper class was not necessary.
2. In loadConfigFiles, the for loop initializing the elements of seenArray to false, was removed,
because the constructor for the primitive boolean array already does this.
3. In loadCSVFile, count was renamed to countColumns for clarity.
4. In the RoomCell class, "NONE" was added to the enum DoorDirection, for the case where the RoomCell is not a door.
5. In loadCSVFile, the else statement that added a RoomCell class to cells was removed, because this code did not need
to be repeated (it does not depend on whether or not r is a door).
